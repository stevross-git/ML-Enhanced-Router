## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ‚úÖ Environment Configuration

- [ ] **Generated secure keys** using `python generate_production_keys.py`
- [ ] **Reviewed** `.env.production.secure` file
- [ ] **Updated domains** in CORS_ORIGINS (replace `yourdomain.com`)
- [ ] **Added AI provider API keys** for production
- [ ] **Set OAuth credentials** from Azure Portal
- [ ] **Configured SMTP settings** for email notifications
- [ ] **Copied environment file**: `cp .env.production.secure .env`

### ‚úÖ Security Validation

- [ ] **Ran security verification**: `python final_production_verification.py`
- [ ] **Confirmed 18/18 security fixes** are passing
- [ ] **Verified no hardcoded secrets** in codebase
- [ ] **Checked CORS origins** contain only trusted domains
- [ ] **Ensured SSL/HTTPS** is configured at load balancer
- [ ] **Validated authentication** is enabled (`AUTH_ENABLED=true`)

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Preparation

- [ ] **Docker environment** ready and tested
- [ ] **Database server** provisioned with backups enabled
- [ ] **Redis server** configured for caching and rate limiting
- [ ] **Load balancer** configured with SSL termination
- [ ] **Monitoring tools** ready (health checks, logs, metrics)
- [ ] **Backup strategy** implemented and tested

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Final Security Check
```bash
# Run comprehensive security verification
python final_production_verification.py

# Expected: 18/18 tests PASSED
```

### Step 2: Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy production environment file
cp .env.production.secure .env

# Verify all required variables are set
python app/utils/production_checks.py
```

### Step 3: Docker Deployment
```bash
# Pull latest images
docker-compose pull

# Deploy in production mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps
```

### Step 4: Health Verification
```bash
# Check application health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# Check database connectivity
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health/db

# Monitor logs for errors
docker-compose logs -f app
```

- ‚úÖ API keys never exposed in responses
- ‚úÖ Sensitive data encryption
- ‚úÖ Secure session management

### Infrastructure Security
- ‚úÖ Docker containers run as non-root user
- ‚úÖ Production environment validation at startup
- ‚úÖ Debug mode disabled in production
- ‚úÖ Traceback exposure prevented

## üìä Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Immediate Checks (First Hour)
- [ ] All services responding to health checks
- [ ] Authentication working correctly
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] No error spikes in logs
- [ ] SSL certificates valid
- [ ] Rate limiting functioning

### Daily Monitoring
- [ ] Application performance metrics
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Rate limit violations
- [ ] Authentication failures
- [ ] Error rates and types
- [ ] Resource utilization

### Weekly Security Review
- [ ] Security log analysis
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts
- [ ] CSRF token violations
- [ ] Unusual traffic patterns
- [ ] Dependency security updates

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Rotate all API keys and passwords
   - Review recent access logs
   - Document incident details

2. **Investigation:**
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Check for data compromise
   - Review system integrity

3. **Recovery:**
   - Deploy security patches
   - Restore from clean backups if needed
   - Enhanced monitoring

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check container resources
docker stats

# Analyze database performance
docker-compose exec db pg_stat_activity

# Review application logs
docker-compose logs --tail=100 app
```

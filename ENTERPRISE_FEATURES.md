# Enterprise Features Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the next-level enterprise features in the ML Query Router, including Cross-Persona Memory Inference, Cognitive Loop Debugging, and Temporal Memory Weighting.

## Overview

The ML Query Router now includes three advanced enterprise features designed to provide transparency, intelligence, and personalization in AI interactions:

1. **Cross-Persona Memory Inference** - Bridges knowledge between different personas while preserving boundaries
2. **Cognitive Loop Debugging** - Provides transparency into AI decision-making processes
3. **Temporal Memory Weighting** - Manages time-aware memory relevance with intelligent decay and revival

## Cross-Persona Memory Inference

### Purpose
Enables intelligent knowledge bridging between different user personas while maintaining privacy boundaries and contextual appropriateness.

### Key Features
- **Persona Compatibility Analysis**: Analyzes relationships between different personas
- **Memory Bridge Suggestions**: Recommends memory sharing opportunities
- **Linkage Graph Generation**: Creates visual representations of persona relationships
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Maintains strict boundaries between personas when needed

### Linkage Types
- **Skill Transfer**: Skills applicable across personas
- **Interest Overlap**: Shared interests between personas
- **Context Bridge**: Contextual connections
- **Preference Sync**: Shared preferences
- **Knowledge Share**: Factual knowledge sharing

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/cross-persona/analyze
GET /api/cross-persona/linkage-graph
GET /api/cross-persona/insights
```

### Usage Example
```python
# Analyze persona compatibility
persona_1_data = {
    "skills": ["analysis", "communication", "problem_solving"],
    "interests": ["technology", "productivity", "efficiency"],
    "preferences": {"formality": 0.8, "structure": 0.9}
}

persona_2_data = {
    "skills": ["research", "critical_thinking", "problem_solving"],
    "interests": ["science", "technology", "learning"],
    "preferences": {"formality": 0.7, "structure": 0.8}
}

linkages = cross_persona_system.analyze_persona_compatibility(
    "work", "learning", persona_1_data, persona_2_data
)
```

## Cognitive Loop Debugging

### Purpose
Provides comprehensive transparency into AI decision-making processes, enabling users to understand how routing decisions are made.

### Key Features
- **Decision Tracking**: Logs all routing decisions with confidence scores
- **Reasoning Explanation**: Provides detailed explanations for decisions
- **Session Management**: Supports session-based debugging
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identifies decision patterns and optimization opportunities

### Decision Types
- **Memory Retrieval**: How memories are selected and retrieved
- **Agent Selection**: Why specific agents are chosen
- **Context Weighting**: How context influences decisions
- **Routing Strategy**: Which routing strategy is applied

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/cognitive/decisions
POST /api/cognitive/explain
POST /api/cognitive/session
```

### Usage Example
```python
# Start debugging session
session_id = cognitive_debugger.start_session("demo_user")

# Log a decision
decision = cognitive_debugger.log_decision(
    user_id="demo_user",
    decision_type=DecisionType.MEMORY_RETRIEVAL,
    decision_made="Retrieved 2 relevant memories",
    reasoning="Relevance to productivity and time management",
    confidence=0.85
)

# Get decision explanation
explanation = cognitive_debugger.explain_decision(decision.decision_id)
```

## Temporal Memory Weighting

### Purpose
Manages memory relevance with intelligent temporal decay and revival mechanisms, ensuring the most relevant memories are prioritized.

### Key Features
- **Time-Aware Relevance**: Calculates memory relevance based on time and access patterns
- **Intelligent Decay**: Automatically reduces memory importance over time
- **Dynamic Revival**: Restores memory relevance when accessed
- **Priority Management**: Handles memory priorities (critical, high, medium, low)

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Never decays, always relevant
- **High**: Slow decay, high revival rate
- **Medium**: Moderate decay and revival
- **Low**: Fast decay, low revival rate

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/temporal/memories
GET /api/temporal/insights
POST /api/temporal/optimize
```

### Usage Example
```python
# Register memory with temporal weighting
memory_id = temporal_memory.register_memory(
    user_id="demo_user",
    memory_id="important_meeting",
    content="Meeting with client about project requirements",
    initial_confidence=0.90,
    priority=MemoryPriority.HIGH
)

# Get temporal insights
insights = temporal_memory.get_memory_insights("demo_user")
```

## Integration with Personal AI Router

All enterprise features are fully integrated with the Personal AI Router:

### Cross-Persona Integration
- Analyzes persona compatibility during routing decisions
- Suggests memory bridging opportunities
- Maintains persona boundaries while enabling selective sharing

### Cognitive Integration
- Tracks all routing decisions with detailed reasoning
- Provides transparency into agent selection processes
- Enables debugging of complex routing scenarios

### Temporal Integration
- Applies time-aware weighting to memory retrieval
- Optimizes memory storage based on usage patterns
- Ensures relevant memories are prioritized

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Cross-Persona Memory Inference
CROSS_PERSONA_ENABLED=true
CROSS_PERSONA_DB_PATH=cross_persona_memory.db
PERSONA_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=true
MEMORY_BRIDGE_SUGGESTIONS=true

# Cognitive Loop Debugging
COGNITIVE_DEBUGGING_ENABLED=true
COGNITIVE_DEBUG_DB_PATH=cognitive_decisions.db
DECISION_TRACKING_ENABLED=true
SESSION_DEBUGGING_ENABLED=true

# Temporal Memory Weighting
TEMPORAL_MEMORY_ENABLED=true
TEMPORAL_MEMORY_DB_PATH=temporal_memory.db
MEMORY_DECAY_ENABLED=true

```

### Database Schema
Each enterprise feature maintains its own database tables:

- **Cross-Persona**: `persona_linkages`, `memory_bridges`, `cross_persona_insights`
- **Cognitive**: `decisions`, `debugging_sessions`, `decision_patterns`
- **Temporal**: `temporal_memories`, `memory_weights`, `access_patterns`

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- All systems are designed for high-throughput operations
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Memory operations are cached for improved performance

### Resource Usage
- Cross-Persona analysis runs on-demand
- Cognitive debugging has minimal overhead
- Temporal memory optimization runs in background

### Monitoring

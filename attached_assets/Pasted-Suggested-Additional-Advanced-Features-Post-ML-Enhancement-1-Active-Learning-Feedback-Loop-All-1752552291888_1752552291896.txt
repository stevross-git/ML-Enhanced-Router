Suggested Additional Advanced Features (Post-ML Enhancement)
🧠 1. Active Learning Feedback Loop
Allow users (or automated validators) to score the router’s output.

Retrain or fine-tune the DistilBERT model incrementally using this real-world feedback.

Bonus: auto-label edge cases for human review.

python
Copy
Edit
feedback = {"query": q, "agent": agent_id, "feedback": "incorrect"}
await redis.rpush("router_feedback_queue", json.dumps(feedback))
🔄 2. Continuous Online Model Updating
Use adapters or LoRA modules to update models in real time with user queries.

Schedule light-weight fine-tuning on domain-specific traffic.

🧬 3. Contextual Memory Routing (Vector Routing)
Inject a ChromaDB/FAISS vector search step before routing:

If query vector is similar to a known past query, reuse or fine-tune routing decision.

python
Copy
Edit
embedding = embedder.encode(query)
results = chroma.query(embedding, top_k=5)
🧱 4. Composable Query Pipelines
Define YAML/JSON pipelines per query class:

yaml
Copy
Edit
code_generation:
  - classify
  - embed
  - rerank
  - route
  - postprocess
Dynamically compose logic chains with fallback.

🧪 5. A/B Testing of Routing Models
Serve N% of traffic to experimental agents or routing strategies.

Log comparative performance and confidence metrics.

🛡️ 6. Semantic Guardrails
Use BERT similarity to block or flag sensitive queries.

Examples:

Self-harm

PII leak attempts

Prompt injection patterns

🧩 7. Router-as-a-Service (RaaS) Interface
Provide an OpenAPI + GraphQL gateway for external services to:

Classify input

Score confidence

Get best route plan

Invoke and stream result

🌐 8. Distributed Mesh Deployment
Deploy multiple routers across zones with:

Gossip-style peer health

Central Prometheus federation

Redis Sentinel or KeyDB for HA caching

📈 9. Live Agent Scoring Dashboard
UI dashboard to show:

Agent accuracy over time

Avg latency and confidence

Routing distribution

ML drift indicators

🧵 10. Traceable Observability with OpenTelemetry
Tag each step (classification, routing, prediction, fallback) with a trace span.

Send traces to Jaeger or Tempo for full-stack visibility.
